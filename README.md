# MSOE-Coding-Standard
The MSOE EECS Department Java Coding Standards, now in native IntelliJ IDEA formats! Also has a few bits from the Google standards that were left out from the MSOE version.
Some things that are not explicitly stated in the rules but will still lose you points are also included.

You may also optionally want to setup Google's (Error Prone)[https://errorprone.info/docs/installation#:~:text=IntelliJ%20IDEA,is%20NOT%20selected.] as an extra safety net.
If you are not using IDEA, you can alternativly use (CheckStyle)[https://csse.msoe.us/cs1011/codingstandard/#:~:text=CheckStyle,for%20this%20screen].
