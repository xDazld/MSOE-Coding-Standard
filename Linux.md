JetBrains IDEs are all available on Linux. **Do not install them as Flatpaks.** Flatpak's sandboxing will break things, and make your life harder. Until JetBrains gets around to fixing [IDEA-22750](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-22750/Debian-package-build-script-provided) some day, you will need to use a third party repository on Ubuntu or your preferred distro. (Alternatively, classic snap packages or Toolbox are available). Once you have IDEA installed, steps are mostly the same as the ones in README.md.

Other things to install:
* Microsoft Teams. They have an official Linux client and a package repo for it. Flathub also has an unofficial client. Having a Teams client is mandatory for productive team work.
* The packages listed in `Ubuntu Packages.txt`. Names might differ slightly on other distros.
* [Liberica Full](https://bell-sw.com/pages/repositories/), get the full variant of the newest version that has stable support in IDEA. If you would rather manually load JavaFX when needed, you can skip this.

If you are looking to install Linux on your school laptop, be warned that the Chemistry labs need Windows available for the program that allows access to the Vernier sensors. Also, the IT department has objections to people not wanting to use Microsoft's OS; installation requires getting the current UEFI setup password from someone and undoing the secure boot blacklist.
