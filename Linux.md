JetBrains IDEs are all available on Linux. **Do not install them as Flatpaks.** Flatpak's sandboxing will break things, and make your life harder. Until JetBrains gets around to fixing [IDEA-22750](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-22750/Debian-package-build-script-provided) some day, you will need to use a third party repository on Ubuntu or your preferred distro. (Alternatively, classic snap packages or Toolbox are available). Once you have IDEA installed, steps are mostly the same as the ones in README.md. You also need to get Microsoft Teams from Microsoft's repository for it, or the 3rd party client from Flathub. The font mentioned in the extra steps section is available in the Ubunutu repository as `fonts-jetbrains-mono`, or Fedora as `jetbrains-mono-fonts`.

If you are looking to install Linux on your school laptop, be warned that the Chemistry labs need Windows available for the program that allows access to the Vernier sensors. Also, the IT department has objections to people not wanting to use Microsoft's OS; installation requires getting the current UEFI setup password from someone and undoing the secure boot blacklist.
